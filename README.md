## step-by-step


Repeat this mini project until it is easy:
1. Setup - On your GitHub account:
  1. Open a new repository and call it something like "study-buddies".
  2. Make a simple README (so your repo can be forked)
2. Project - take turns assigning issues and making pull requests:
  * Go around the circle taking turns as "repository owner (RO)" - the person who started the repo and who merges pull requests
  1. The RO will ask questions:
    1. Create on issue in their repo for each person in the group
      * Use the issues to ask each person a question like, "do you have brothers or sisters?"
      * Mention the person you're asking in the body of the issue (ie. @username)
  2. Each person will answer their RO's question:
      1. Find your mentioned issues in issues/mentioned
      2. Follow the link to the project repo
      3. Create a fork of the RO's repo
      4. In the fork, create a new file and answer their question
      5. Send them a pull request, mention your issue in the body (ie. #3)
  3. The RO will accept or reject each answer:
      1. Check pull requests
      2. Review the answers
      3. Either merge, or ask for better answers
      4. Close each person's issue once you've accepted their answers
